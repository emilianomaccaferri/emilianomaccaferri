### Hello there
I'm Emiliano Maccaferri and I'm a freelance fullstack web developer.
I mainly focus on backend but I'm constantly striving to get the best UIs I can when working with clients.

When not working or wrapping my head around projects I often travel and/or buy unnecessarily expensive clothes.
I occasionally <a href="https://youtube.com/c/MaccaBeats">make music</a>

See you around and hit me up on Telegram (@macca_ferri) if you need anything!
